# Chicken Research

A bad attempt at determining the weight of a chicken based on a ratio of the area of a "magic" blue square to the area of the chicken obtained through image segmentation.

## Methodology

1. take image of chicken with blue square on its back
2. put image into `chicken_train`
3. run augmentation on images & resize to width = 300
4. train model

Note: full dataset not added
